# Republic Mod Manager – source

Windows program (C#, WinForms, .NET Framework 4) that lists the subscribed TesmioLoader
plugin packages, renders their settings from the package schema, switches plugins on and
off, keeps the Workshop Bridge list and starts the game through the TesmioLauncher.
The user guide is `README_DE.md` (German), the schema reference `SCHEMA_DE.md`.
Distributed as a Steam Workshop item; the item's installer and guides are in `workshop/`.

## Layout

| Folder / file | Content |
|---|---|
| `src/*.cs` | application sources (`App.cs` is the entry point) |
| `tests/CoreTests.cs`, `tests/UiTests.cs` | offline tests, run against the fixture package in `packages/` |
| `tests/BuildIcon.cs` | builds `assets/rmm.ico` from `assets/rmm-icon.png` during the build |
| `languages/de.ini`, `languages/en.ini` | user interface strings, embedded into the executable |
| `settings_schemas/` | settings pages for the plugins that ship with the TesmioLoader (DE in `languages/de.ini`, EN fallbacks in the `.launcher.ini`) |
| `packages/3794994476/` | test fixture: a Vehicle Materials package without its DLL |
| `workshop/` | the Steam Workshop item: `Install-RMM.bat`, `Uninstall-RMM.bat`, `Install-RMM.ps1`, guides, `WOHIN.txt` / `WHERE.txt` and the default `rmm.ini` |

## Building

Windows with .NET Framework 4 (the compiler `csc.exe` ships with it), then:

```
build.bat
```

Output in `bin\`: `rmm.exe`, `CoreTests.exe`, `UiTests.exe`, plus a copy of `settings_schemas\`.
The build uses `/warnaserror+`, so every warning stops it.

## Tests

```
bin\CoreTests.exe packages\3794994476 tests\runs\core_<stamp>
bin\UiTests.exe packages\3794994476 tests\runs\ui_<stamp>
```

The output folder must not exist yet. Some core tests expect the fixture's DLL beside its INI
(`packages\3794994476\hooks\vehicle_materials.dll`); build the Vehicle Materials plugin from
`plugins/vehicle_materials` and copy the DLL there before running them.

## Installing into the game

Copy `bin\rmm.exe`, `settings_schemas\`, `README_DE.md` (as `rmm.README_DE.md`) and
`SCHEMA_DE.md` (as `rmm.SCHEMA_DE.md`) into `<game>\tesmioloader\build`, or use the Workshop
item's `Install-RMM.bat`, which also installs the Workshop Bridge from `plugins/workshop_bridge`.
