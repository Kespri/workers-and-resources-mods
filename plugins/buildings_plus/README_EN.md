# 🏭 Buildings Plus 0.1.8

**TesmioLoader plugin for new buildings from a configuration file**

Adds new buildings to *Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic* 1.1.1.9 without modelling or copying anything by hand: you name a donor building of the game (say, the bauxite mine) and the building.ini lines that should differ (say, `$PRODUCTION raw_salt 1.0`). At every game start the plugin writes a complete Workshop item into `media_soviet\workshop_wip` from that, with model, textures, collision data, icon and the adjusted building.ini. Typical use: a salt mine and a salt refinery for new resources, without touching the game's coal mine.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements
- Windows x64
- WRSR 1.1.1.9 (reference version; the plugin reads no game address, a game update can at most make a building.ini line invalid)
- TesmioLoader API 4
- Resources a building consumes or produces must exist in the game, for example through the Resources plugin.

### In three steps
1. **Choose one installation method** (see below) and enable the plugin.
2. **Declare buildings:** in Republic Mod Manager press "Add" on the Buildings tab and fill in object name, donor, name in the game and the lines (the Workshop id may stay empty). By hand: one section in `buildings_plus.ini`, like the shipped example `[example_pharmacy]` (disabled).
3. **Restart the game completely.** The building appears in the build menu under its `name`; the log shows one line per section with folder and donor.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core function
- ✅ One section per building: donor, changed lines, done
- ✅ A complete Workshop item at game start: model, material (texture paths rewritten), the donor's emissive material, collision box, fire points, icon, workshopconfig.ini, renderconfig.ini, building.ini
- ✅ The donor's geometry survives whole (connections, construction phases, particles, vehicle stations); only what you declare is replaced
- ✅ Folders are rewritten only when the section, the plugin or a donor file changed
- ✅ A folder without the plugin's stamp is never touched; real Workshop subscriptions are safe
- ✅ `prune` removes the folders of disabled or deleted sections again
- ✅ The same section format Soviet Mod Loader reads from a mod's `tesmio\buildings.ini`

---

## 💾 Installation

Buildings Plus ships with Republic Mod Manager: the installer of the RMM package puts `buildings_plus.dll` and `buildings_plus.ini` under `tesmioloader\build\plugins\`, and the "Manual Installation" folder contains both for copying over. Then switch the plugin on in Republic Mod Manager. If you get the plugin on its own, choose **one** of the methods below. The same DLL must never be loaded twice.

---

### Method 1️⃣: Classic TesmioLoader

```
1. Copy buildings_plus.dll and buildings_plus.ini from hooks\
   → tesmioloader\build\plugins\

2. Enable buildings_plus in TesmioLauncher
3. Declare sections in the INI, restart the game completely
```

---

### Method 2️⃣: Soviet Mod Loader (SML)

```
SML brings its own building generator and reads tesmio\buildings.ini from
every mod. Buildings Plus is not needed there; a mod with tesmio\buildings.ini
runs the same under SML and under Republic Mod Manager.
```

---

### Method 3️⃣: Workshop Bridge (without SML)

```
1. Select the package in Republic Mod Manager
2. Switch "Plugin active" on
3. workshop_bridge loads the DLL straight from the package
```

---

### Method 4️⃣: Republic Mod Manager with "Files local only"

```
1. Select the package in Republic Mod Manager, declare buildings, Save
2. "General" tab, "Notes" card: switch "Files local only" on
3. Confirmation with file list → DLL and INI are copied to
   tesmioloader\build\plugins\ on save
```

---

## 🧰 Republic Mod Manager

The package ships an editor schema in the `config` folder. Republic Mod Manager shows Buildings Plus in three tabs, German and English:

- **General:** notes, guides, the card "Generated folders" with the switches Fill in the owner id and Clean up folders (prune), plus the card "Troubleshooting" with Always rewrite (always) and Detailed log
- **Buildings:** one row per building with its switch, name, number, donor, state and the buttons Change, Open and Delete. "Add" and "Change…" open the very same window with two tabs: **Details** (object name, Workshop id, donor, name in the game, description, life) and **Lines** (the donor's building.ini beside your own lines, showing which donor lines each of yours removes)
- **SML buildings:** what Soviet Mod Loader generated into `media_soviet\workshop_wip` itself, with the button that fills in a missing owner id

Republic Mod Manager does not offer the `object` key - there the object name is always the section name. Written by hand, `object` still counts.

Personal buildings live in `user_config\buildings_plus.editor.ini`, the effective file is `plugins\buildings_plus.ini`; the INI in the package stays untouched.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Main file: `buildings_plus.ini`

The DLL reads in this order:
- **First:** `tesmioloader\build\plugins\buildings_plus.ini` if it exists (classic installation, "Files local only", or the effective INI written by Republic Mod Manager)
- **Otherwise:** the INI beside the DLL, in the package `hooks\buildings_plus.ini`

⚠️ **Comments only on their own lines with `;`.** The file must be UTF-8 without BOM. Never write a `$TOKEN` into a comment line inside a building section. Changes take effect after a complete game restart.

### Section `[buildings_plus]`

```ini
[buildings_plus]
; 1 generates the buildings at game start, 0 does not load the plugin (folders stay)
enabled = 1
; 1 removes folders of deleted or disabled sections (only with the plugin's stamp)
prune = 0
; 1 rewrites every folder at every start
always = 0
; 1 logs every copied file and every removed donor line
verbose = 0
; 1 also fills the Steam id into generated folders of other generators
repair_owner_ids = 1
```

### Buildings: one section per building

```ini
[salt_mine]
enabled = 1
; Workshop id, optional: leave it out and the plugin assigns one from 9300000000 and remembers it
; id = 9300000001
; donor: a name under media_soviet\buildings_types without .ini
donor = bauxite_mine
; object name (folder and $OBJECT_BUILDING), default = section name
object = SaltMine
; name in the build menu and in the Workshop entry, no quotes
name = Salt Mine
; description, one desc line per line
desc = Mines raw salt from a salt deposit.
; building.ini lines, in this order in front of the donor lines
line = $PRODUCTION raw_salt 1.0
line = $STORAGE_EXPORT RESOURCE_TRANSPORT_OPEN 20
; donor lines dropped without replacement
strip = $WORKERS_NEEDED
```

**Entries that span several lines.** Some building.ini tokens carry their values in the lines below them — a connection its points, a goods display its placement. A `line` without a `$TOKEN` belongs to the line above it, exactly as in the game's own file:

```ini
line = $CONNECTION_WATERPIPE_INPUT
line = -92.5 -3.2 5.0
line = -91.5 -3.2 5.0
line = $RESOURCE_VISUALIZATION 0
line = position 15.2912 0.0 -51.6213
line = rotation 0.0
line = scale 1 1 1
line = numstepx 3.0 12
line = numstept 4.0 3
```

The first `line` of a section has to carry a `$TOKEN` — otherwise it would have nothing to belong to, and a typo there would quietly turn into a data line.

The donor sets the shape: a mine wants a mine as donor (conveyor, animation), a factory a factory, a shop a shop. `life` (default 3000) is the LIFE value in renderconfig.ini.

**A Workshop building as the donor.** Instead of a base-game name you may point at a building of a Workshop item you are subscribed to:

```ini
donor = 1872558150\gravelmine
```

The item id on the left, the building's folder inside that item on the right — the spelling Vanilla Buildings uses for its target files. The item is looked for in the game's Workshop folder and in `media_soviet\workshop_wip`, so a building of your own that is not published yet works as well.

What happens: the chosen folder is copied, together with every loose file of the item and every subfolder that holds no building of its own — asset folders are called `mtl`, `Textures` or `materials` depending on who built them, so what counts is what is in a folder, never its name. The other buildings of a multi-building item stay behind: one section is one building. The donor's `workshopconfig.ini` is not taken over; your clone gets one of its own that lists your building alone. The donor's `renderconfig.ini` stays, because it knows the donor's own file names.

Two things to keep in mind: you have to be subscribed to the item, or the section is skipped with an error line — and nothing of it ships with this plugin, the copy is made on your own machine. If you want to publish the result on the Workshop yourself, you need the original author's permission.

**Workshop id:** just leave `id` out. At game start the plugin looks for the highest number between 9300000000 and 9399999999 (in the catalog, in the INI and among the folders under workshop_wip, foreign ones included) and assigns the next one. The number then lives in `plugins\buildings_plus.ids.ini` under the section name and stays there for good, because saved games know the building by its folder `workshop_wip\<number>`. A renamed section is a new building with a new number; a deleted section does not free its number. An explicit `id` (9000000000 to 9999999999) still works and wins. Keep the catalog file together with your saved games; profiles in Republic Mod Manager include it.

**A name from the text pack.** Normally you just write the name down, `name = Salt Mine`. It then sits in the file and reads the same in every game language.

With the Localization plugin running you may write a translation key instead:

```ini
name = localization.lang.salt_mine
```

Buildings Plus looks the key up at game start and writes the id it finds into building.ini, exactly the way the base game does it for its own buildings. The caption then comes from the Localization pack: in the game language when the pack carries it, in its fallback language otherwise. A value counts as a key when it holds at least one dot and nothing but letters, digits, dot, underscore and hyphen, so a name with spaces can never be mistaken for one.

Without Localization, or with a key it does not know, Buildings Plus uses the part after the last dot as the name, here `salt_mine`, and writes one warning into the log. The building still works.

---

## 🛠️ Replacement rules

The donor's building.ini is taken over line by line. A donor line is dropped only when one of your lines replaces it or `strip` names it.

| Your line starts with | Dropped from the donor |
|---|---|
| the same token | the same line |
| `$NAME_STR` (from `name`) or `$NAME` | every `$NAME` line |
| a `$TYPE_*` | every `$TYPE_*` line, only one type is in effect |
| a `$STORAGE*` | every `$STORAGE*` line and `$RESOURCE_VISUALIZATION`, because the visualisation counts storages from zero |
| `$PRODUCTION`, `$CONSUMPTION` or `$CONSUMPTION_PER_SECOND` | all three: a recipe is replaced as a whole |

`$PRODUCTION_SEWAGE_POLLUTION` and `$CONSUMPTION_WATER_REQUIRED_QUALITY` are settings, not a recipe, and stay. What counts is the first `$TOKEN` anywhere in the line, the way the game's parser does it.

---

## 📏 Value ranges

| Quantity | Limit |
|---|---|
| `enabled`, `prune`, `always`, `verbose`, `repair_owner_ids` | exactly 0 or 1 |
| building sections | at most 256 |
| `id` | optional; number from 9000000000 to 9999999999, unique in the file; assigned from 9300000000 when absent |
| `object`, section name | letters, digits, `_` and `-`, at most 64 characters |
| `donor` | a base-game name like `object`; a Workshop donor `<item id>\<folder>`, at most 96 characters per part, no `..` |
| `name` | at most 128 characters, no quotes; with dots it is a translation key |
| `desc` | at most 4096 characters, no quotes |
| `life` | 1 to 1000000 |
| `line` per section | at most 512, each at most 4096 characters, each with a `$TOKEN` |
| `strip` | exactly one `$TOKEN` per line |
| text file read | at most 4 MiB |

A section with an error is skipped and named in the log; the other sections continue.

## 🔒 Safety rules

- Writing happens only under `media_soviet\workshop_wip`; no game file is modified, Steam's verification stays happy.
- Every generated folder carries `tesmioloader.stamp`. A folder without that stamp is never touched, even with the same id; the section is refused.
- `prune` deletes only folders with this plugin's stamp, never subscriptions and never folders of another generator.
- In a folder of another generator at most a missing `$OWNER_ID` is filled in - one number, not a single byte more. The stamp is left alone: Soviet Mod Loader closes the game when a folder in its id range carries none.
- Ids below 9000000000 are refused, so no real Steam number can be hit.
- Automatically assigned numbers are kept in `plugins\buildings_plus.ids.ini` and are never handed out a second time, not even after a section is deleted.
- Files are written under a temporary name first and then moved into place; a crash leaves no half-written building.ini.
- The plugin checks the shape of the declaration, not the meaning of the game directives. A wrong line is reported by the game in its own log.

---

## 💾 Compatibility

### Saved games
Generated buildings are Workshop items with a fixed id. A saved game containing one needs the folder when loading; remove sections only when no saved game uses the building any more.

The plugin writes your **Steam id** into the `workshopconfig.ini` - the id of the player whose machine the building is generated on. When a saved game is loaded the game checks who owns the Workshop items it uses; with a zero in there it reports "the Workshop items used in this saved game were not found". The save still loads, but the message comes back every time. The number is read from the registry of the signed-in Steam account, otherwise from the `loginusers.vdf` of your Steam installation; if neither answers the zero stays and the next start with Steam signed in fills it in. None of this travels with the package - every copy carries the id of whoever generated it.

**Buildings of other generators too.** Soviet Mod Loader brings its own buildings component and always writes `$OWNER_ID 0`, so the message hits everyone who builds a building from a content package, and there is hardly a way to get rid of it by hand. With `repair_owner_ids = 1` (the default) Buildings Plus also looks into generated folders it did not write itself and fills in **only the missing number**; every other byte of the file stays as it was, line endings included. All four conditions have to hold: the folder name is a generated id (9000000000 to 9999999999), the folder carries a `tesmioloader.stamp`, the file names no owner at all, and your own id could be determined. A folder that already names somebody is never touched, and neither is the stamp. The timing fits: SML generates during its start-up phase, Buildings Plus runs after it - a folder just rewritten is put right in the same launch.

### Soviet Mod Loader
A mod with `[content] buildings = tesmio\buildings.ini` in its soviet.mod.ini runs under SML with its own generator and under Republic Mod Manager with Buildings Plus. The section format is the same.

### Other plugins
Resources in `$PRODUCTION`, `$CONSUMPTION` and `$STORAGE_*` must exist in the game (base game or the Resources plugin). Deposits for mines come from Deposits Plus. Vanilla Buildings changes existing buildings, Buildings Plus adds new ones.

### Version compatibility
- **0.1.8:** the missing Steam id is filled into generated folders of other generators as well — Soviet Mod Loader always leaves a zero there; switch `repair_owner_ids`, on by default
- **0.1.7:** the generated `workshopconfig.ini` carries the Steam id of the player who generated it — without it the game reports "the Workshop items used in this saved game were not found" on every load
- **0.1.6:** a `line` without a `$TOKEN` belongs to the line above it — connections, goods displays and everything else that needs data lines can now be declared
- **0.1.5:** ids between 9100000000 and 9199999999 are refused — Soviet Mod Loader reserves that range for its own buildings, and a foreign folder in it stops the game from starting
- **0.1.4:** `donor` may be a building of a subscribed Workshop item, written `<item id>\<folder>`; the clone is made on your own machine
- **0.1.3:** `name` may be a translation key; the name is then written as `$NAME` with the resolved id and the caption comes from the Localization pack
- **0.1.2:** first published version

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### Common problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| building missing from the build menu | section `enabled = 0`, plugin off or an error in the section | read the log, enable the section, restart the game |
| `id must lie between ...` | id outside 9000000000 to 9999999999 | change the id |
| `exists and was not written by this plugin` | folder without stamp under workshop_wip | pick another id or check the foreign folder |
| building appears twice after renaming a section | new section name = new number, the old folder stays | switch `prune` on or delete the old folder |
| `donor "..." has no ...` | donor name wrong or not installed | name from `media_soviet\buildings_types` without `.ini` |
| game crashes on the first frame | donor with emissive material but `material_e.mtl` missing | delete the folder, restart the game; look for "emissive material" in the log |
| `name must be plain text` | quotes in `name` or `desc` | remove the quotes |

### Logging

Results go to `tesmioloader.log` (sender `buildings_plus`), everything else to the detail log `logs\tesmioloader.buildings_plus.log`. With `verbose = 1` it lists every copied file and every removed donor line.
- In **Republic Mod Manager** the document icon at the bottom of the plugin bar opens the log view with filter and sender.

Search for:
- `configuration:` → which INI the DLL chose and how many sections
- `-> <id>\<object> from "<donor>"` → a building was written
- `up to date` → nothing changed
- `prune:` → a folder was removed
- `ERROR:` → a section was skipped, with line and reason

## 📜 Licence & Credits

**GNU GPL v3**, see `LICENSE` in the package. Buildings Plus is a fork of the `buildings` plugin from TesmioLoader by MaxLegend (GPL v3); layout and replacement rules come from there, the validation, the cleanup, the detail log and the path handling are new. The complete source code is at https://github.com/Kespri/workers-and-resources-mods/tree/main/plugins/buildings_plus.

**Attention, comrade:** this plugin was written with the help of an artificial intelligence. The five-year plans behind it were still drawn up, tested and sworn at by a human every time the game crashed. If you do not want AI in your code, just stick to the base game. No hard feelings, no re-education.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Are my game files modified?**
A: No. Only new folders under `media_soviet\workshop_wip` appear, which the game reads like unpublished Workshop items.

**Q: Can I swap the donor's model?**
A: Not through the plugin. Make a Workshop item of your own for that; Buildings Plus is for buildings that look like a donor and behave differently.

**Q: Why can the id not be smaller?**
A: Real Steam items have numbers around 3.8 billion. From 9 billion on there can never be an overlap.

**Q: Do I have to give an id?**
A: No. Without `id` the plugin assigns the next free number from 9300000000 and keeps it in `plugins\buildings_plus.ids.ini`. The range deliberately sits beside the one Soviet Mod Loader uses (9100000000 upwards).

**Q: What happens when I delete a section?**
A: With `prune = 1` the generated folder disappears at the next start; otherwise it stays and the game keeps loading the building.
