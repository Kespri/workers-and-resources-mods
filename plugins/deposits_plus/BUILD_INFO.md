# Deposits Plus – build notes

Fork of the `deposits` plugin from the TesmioLoader by MaxLegend (Tesmio), GPL v3. Target:
WRSR 1.1.1.9 (SOVIET64.exe SHA-256 `296644A9F207D609031FC2AE73FED2DCB34619A1D55A35D1C7B51965CE6841B8`),
TesmioLoader API 4. Build: the standard line of the root `build.bat` (`cl /O2 /MT /W3 /EHsc /LD`,
kernel32.lib) compiles `deposits_plus.cpp`; the headers `deposit_generation.h`, `deposit_country.h`,
`deposit_visual_shader.h` and the `.inl` files are included, `third_party` holds Microsoft's DXIL
hash helper (see below). Service name `deposits` and the savegame file `tesmio_deposits.bin`
deliberately stay identical to the original so consumers such as Depletion keep working.
User documentation: README_DE.md / README_EN.md. History newest first.

## 0.4.3 (2026-09-10)

- Diagnostic only: `generation occupancy:` log line before the gap dilation with the reserved cells per
  source (resourcemap R/G/B, resourcemap2 R/G, mask B, tombstones), the live mask texture's size and
  non-zero count per channel, and the union. Reason: on the Siberia and Asia DLC maps the placement
  reserved 724009 / 624610 cells although the resource maps on disk cover about 157000 / 115000 cells
  (offline replay incl. a 3-cell gap: 198504 / 147392); sand, clay and gas then found no room while
  copper still fit. The runtime mask texture is the suspect; the line will tell.
- Version 0.4.3. Backup: `_backups\deposits_plus_0.4.2_before_0.4.3_*`.

## 0.4.2 (2026-09-10)

- Tile files may live in set folders under `deposits_plus\assets`: `color` / `normal` are paths relative to
  the assets folder (`Siberia/sand_meadow_siberia_color.dds`); `VsAssetPathOk` refuses `..` elements, drive
  letters and absolute paths, everything else goes straight into the existing `VsReadFile` join. The
  `SandTile` fields for both names grew to 128 characters.
- Shipped assets are sorted into sets: `Vanilla` (meadow summer/autumn), `Siberia` (summer, snow-dusted
  autumn), `Asia - Jungle` (summer) and `Ultimate Vanilla +` (meadow pair matching that texture pack,
  not referenced by default). All colour files DXT1, all normal maps DXT5 with height in alpha,
  1024x1024, 11 mips. The shipped `[sand_tile:]` table points at the set files; Siberia and jungle no
  longer reuse the meadow pair.
- Package schema: the two file fields are grouped file lists with a pre-save check (Republic Mod
  Manager 0.4.48: `picker = files`, `reference = files`, `reference_format = dds_dxt1|dds_dxt5`).
- Version 0.4.2. Backup: `_backups\deposits_plus_0.4.1_before_0.4.2_*`.

## 0.4.1 (2026-09-10)

- Sand surface tile table: `[sand_tile:<id>]` sections (`base` = terrain base texture on material slot 5
  with its folder, `color` / `normal` = DDS files in `deposits_plus\assets`) replace the two hard-coded
  meadow names. `VsTile` matches the engine's texture path from the end as a whole path element, so
  `dlc2/tiles_siberia/grass2.dds` and `tiles_normal/grass2.dds` are different entries; a base without an
  entry, or an entry whose files fail to load, stays native. `VsDds` accepts any square power-of-two side
  from 256 to 4096 with a complete mip chain (file limit 48 MB). An INI without `[sand_tile:]` sections
  falls back to the classic meadow summer/autumn pair. The shipped INI maps meadow, Siberia (summer and
  the snow-dusted autumn `grass2snow.dds`) and jungle; Siberia/jungle reuse the meadow files until the
  user supplies their own. Winter and desert bases have no entry.
- `desert_fill = 1` per deposit: when the world's `script.ini` (shipped with saves too) says
  `$TYPE_DESERT`, the first distribution of that deposit fills every non-water cell of its 1024x1024
  map at full richness (`GenerationRun`, before the random placement branch; record status 1). Only a
  deposit that never held data is filled; saved data is never touched. Infinite unless Depletion mines
  it down. Shipped on for `[sand]`.
- Parser: `[sand_tile:]` sections are not deposits; unknown tile keys are logged and ignored.
- Version 0.4.1. Backup: `_backups\deposits_plus_0.4.0_before_0.4.1_*`.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-07)

Version numbering restarts in beta with the September rework: 0.4.0 supersedes the unreleased
1.8.1-beta build of the same day and follows 1.8.0-beta. Scheme from here on: 0.M.P, patch
increments per change, the next minor when a change is large.

- The legacy detail keys `generation_count`, `generation_radius_min_m` and
  `generation_radius_max_m` are no longer read; `generation_frequency` (1..6 regions) and
  `generation_size` (1..3 radius classes) are the only way to size the generation, an absent
  preset keeps the defaults (3 regions, class 2). The mixed-settings warning went with them;
  an old INI that still carries the keys gets the usual unknown-key handling. Shipped INI,
  READMEs and the RMM schema of the Workshop package no longer mention them.
- Workshop package texts (schema, de/en) reworked by the user: shorter descriptions, the
  saved-game warning moved to the Deposits tab, headings "Natural generation" and "Working
  vehicles" in the detail panel (needs Republic Mod Manager 0.34.4).
- No change to hooks, savegame format or `tesmio_deposits.bin`.

## 1.8.0-beta (2026-09-06)

- Assets are looked up beside the DLL first (`<DLL folder>\deposits_plus\assets`), then under
  `plugins\deposits_plus\assets`; the folder found is logged (`sand surface assets from ...`).
- `TsmPluginInit` returns 1 ("deposits_plus idle") while the upstream `plugins\deposits.dll`
  exists and is enabled in tesmioloader.ini, so both never run together.
- Workshop package `My Plugins\3796823002` with `local_copy = 1`, `[assets] dir = hooks\deposits_plus`
  and an RMM keyed_sections schema (tabs General / Sand structure / Deposits).

## 1.7.x – sandy meadow surface

Optional ground visuals over the independent sand deposits: the meadow texture with irregular
sand traces is blended in at sand deposits; the resource density drives the transition.
Settings `sand_surface`, `sand_surface_strength` (0.0–1.0), `sand_surface_token` in
`[deposits_plus]`; the token must be a deposit with `independent_map = 1`.

- 1.7.1: the game loader's normal shader class linkage is passed through unchanged (1.7 had
  wrongly excluded it; reproduced in a separate test and verified with the real FX loader from
  the installed engine DLL in a WARP test process).
- 1.7.2: the hook is applied inside the actual virtual `CreateShaders` call. `CreateManagedShaders`
  only creates an empty object and does not trigger pixel-shader creation, which is why the 1.7.1
  in-game test still showed `PS calls=0`. The whole native sequence (object creation, later file
  load, cache use, reset and reload) was verified.
- 1.7.3: own autumn variant combining the sand traces with the brown palette of `grass2_fall.dds`;
  summer and autumn use separate colour/normal textures, also during the seasonal blend. The
  native order is summer → autumn → snow; 1.7.2 had autumn and snow swapped in the material
  selection, so the sand look could vanish on the switch to the brown meadow. `grass2_snow.dds`
  and the native snow calculation are not replaced. No new INI keys.

Technique: the extra texture is injected at load time into 13 identified native terrain pixel
shaders; their existing sequence for terrain blending, light, fog and snow is kept. Sampling
uses the native UVs, samplers and derivatives; only RGB is blended, the original alpha stays.
No shader file is changed. The selection mask is the current GPU resource map; its identity is
re-checked on a world change; no GPU readback or full resource copy per frame. Unknown
engine/shader builds, missing assets, unsuitable resource formats and binding slots taken by
other mods disable only this visual with a concrete warning; other Deposits Plus features stay
independent. Assets: four DDS 1024 × 1024 with eleven mip levels, colour BC1/DXT1, normal
BC3/DXT5; `build.bat` copies them into `plugins\deposits_plus\assets`.

Offline verification: all 13 original shaders with D3D11/WARP, rendered mask/light/snow
fixtures, DDS loading, season flags, world-map change, temporary shader hooks and restoration
of the graphics bindings; both seasonal colour/normal pairs with 69,120 GPU pixel comparisons;
material accesses of the installed engine. In game confirmed earlier: summer look, shrinking
with Depletion, save/load. Still open: a visual and performance test of the autumn variant
(summer → autumn → snow → melt, reload from the main menu). Expected log lines:
`sand surface shader preparation: 13/13 verified native programs augmented`,
`sand surface active: token=$TYPE_MINE_SAND ...`,
`sand surface terrain selection: season=2 transition=0 surface=autumn/native ...`.
`prepared` alone means the hooks are in place, not that anything was rendered yet.

Third-party code: `third_party/d3d12TokenizedProgramFormat.hpp` and `third_party/DxilHash.cpp`
are unchanged from Microsoft's DirectXShaderCompiler repository (University of Illinois Open
Source License, `third_party/LICENSE.TXT`, shipped as `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSE.txt`). The hash
helper computes the DXBC format checksum only; it is not a security signature check.

## 1.6-beta – natural generation inside the country border

- Every loaded world: all resources of the current INI are matched by token against the
  savegame's history. Unknown empty resources and empty resources that were only skipped so far
  are generated once. Existing or already initialised deposits stay, also after full depletion.
  No built-in resource lists, savegame names or world ids.
- Natural, elongated, winding fields with varying width, occasional branches, irregular edges,
  real gaps and fading richness; a field may consist of several separate patches but counts
  once. Isolated grid points are removed.
- No placement in water: terrain heights inside every resource cell are checked against water
  level, wave amplitude and a safety margin, plus the shore distance (`generation_shore_m`,
  `generation_water_clearance_m`).
- Only inside the country border: a verified snapshot of the loaded native `BORDER_POLYGON`;
  without a polygon the native rectangular build limits apply. Border cells are excluded
  conservatively. The border structure is verified against the installed engine; an unknown or
  invalid structure suppresses new placements instead of placing outside the country.
- No overlap with other newly generated fields, existing plugin deposits or Vanilla
  oil/iron/coal/uranium/bauxite/gravel (`generation_gap_m`). Existing overlaps are not changed.
- Round robin over all new resources: at most one field and 32 attempts per turn, then the next
  resource; the order rotates with the saved seed. At most 256 attempts per requested field.
- Water, border and occupied pieces are cut away; a field counts only when at least 60 % of its
  original area remains after clipping and removal of tiny remnants (size 3 is not a remnant).
  Otherwise another place is tried.
- The log names target/result, clipped fields, attempts and the separate rejection reasons:
  country border, water/shore, deposits/gap, map edge, too little remaining area.
- First generation runs once at the first terrain draw after loading; no continuous generator.
- Levels: `generation_frequency` 1–6 (desired fields 1–6) and `generation_size` 1–3 (base
  measure 150–350 / 350–550 / 550–750 m). The base measure is chosen per field and scales its
  whole course; the elongated course spans about 3.4 to 4.6 times the base measure along its
  main axis. Precedence independent of line order: `generation_frequency` overrides
  `generation_count`, `generation_size` overrides both `generation_radius_*`; mixtures are
  logged with resource and overridden keys. Invalid levels disable only that resource's
  generation with a warning. Defaults since 1.6: frequency 3, size 2
  (`generation_count = 3`, radius 350–550 m, richness 0.45–1.00).
- Sand: the shipped INI keeps `map = terrain` / `component = 1` as the origin note and adds
  `independent_map = 1`; the plugin assigns sand its own separate channel after the existing
  auto channels. On the first adoption of an old savegame without metadata the terrain richness
  is adopted (area-averaged from terrain to resource resolution) unless a sand deposit already
  exists; if that is empty too, the general first distribution applies. The visible terrain
  mask is neither recoloured nor reduced by sand mining; the sand brush now lives in the
  editor's resource tab. Switching back to a terrain mask is not a supported migration.

Metadata `tesmio_deposits.bin`: versioned, checksummed identities, channel mapping, seed and
history of removed resources; written after the native map save from its DDS files and
replaced atomically through a temporary file; both are needed on load. History states:
adopted, generated, not yet initialised, generation attempted but no/too little room. Metadata
from 1.3 stays readable: `status=2` (skipped back then) counts as a pending first distribution
while the channel is still empty; once data is adopted or saved in such a channel it is marked
initialised, and later mining does not reset that. Limit with old data: without metadata the
plugin cannot prove that an empty channel was never mined; `generate_existing_empty = 0` then
protects old or incompletely initialised empty entries. That option is never a regeneration
command. Worlds from `media_soviet/save/...` and `saved_last` count as old savegames without
metadata, terrain templates as new worlds. Unreadable/invalid metadata, missing original map
files, contradicting types, unknown DDS formats or missing engine functions produce warnings
and suppress new generation and metadata overwrites; a broken file is never interpreted as a
new empty world. A full rollback to 1.2-beta needs the old savegame and the old INI.

Offline verification: all 18 level combinations, fair round-robin distribution, INI-order
independence, clipping/minimum area, concave country borders and border cells, layout
signature of the installed engine, water/occupancy masks, no overlap, bounded search, metadata
checksums, re-adding, re-sorting, depletion, remove/re-adopt, sand adoption and unchanged
native vehicle gates; plus a test with the real border, height and Vanilla occupancy data of
the coastal map template with several seeds. The engine binding still has to be tested in
game (new test map, resource minimap on, save, reload from the menu and after a restart, then
add exactly one new resource in a savegame copy). Log lines start with `generation`.

## 1.2-beta – working vehicles for own deposits

Per deposit section: `working_vehicle_skill = gravelmining` (or `none`, case-insensitive;
unknown values warn and disable only the vehicle extension of that section). The building
stays `$TYPE_MINE_SAND` (building_type 7) and still needs `$WORKING_VEHICLES_NEEDED`,
`$VEHICLE_PARKING` places and the normal operating conditions; vehicles use their existing
`$SKILL_GRAVELMINING`, there is no `$SKILL_SANDMINING`. The deposit map and the `$PRODUCTION`
resource are not changed; sand is not switched from `map=terrain` to another map. Fuel, state,
capacity and production rules of the game stay.

Technique: four native type checks are extended by the explicitly configured mine types:
vehicle admission for purchase/assignment, two work-performance calculation paths and the
arrival/work state of pit vehicles. No building or vehicle types are rewritten in memory; the
original branches for gravel and bauxite stay first; an additional check limits new assignments
to building type 7. Installed at plugin start only; all four sites including surrounding
identification bytes are verified against 1.1.1.9 first. Deviating bytes or a preparation
failure leave all four checks untouched; without an active assignment no vehicle patch is
installed; `code_patch = 0` disables this extension too; other plugins rewriting the same sites
cause a warning and rejection. No new save format, no periodic vehicle scans, no change to the
executable on disk. Log prefix `vehicles`; successful start: `4 native gates installed` plus
one assignment line per released mine.

Offline verification against the installed executable: DLL built with the central build.bat
switches; 24,960 real x64 test calls of the original/extension branches (registers and defined
arithmetic flags, Vanilla behaviour, unconfigured types, building-type separation, limits and
up to 32 deposits); INI parser, defaults, invalid values, existing extra keys; four sites and
preconditions checked directly against executable bytes; deviating bytes and memory/protection/
cache failures before activation tested, never partially installed vehicle branches; a
successful installation changes only the four intended areas of a private in-memory copy.
In-game test protocol: open a sand mine with vehicle places over a sand deposit, buy or assign
an excavator, check mining without workers, missing fuel, full storage and resumption, save/
load, vehicle change, and that a normal gravel/bauxite mine and an unconfigured mine behave as
before.
