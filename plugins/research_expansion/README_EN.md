# 🔬 Research Expansion 1.7

**TesmioLoader plugin for new research and changes to the research tree**

Adds your own research entries to *Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic* 1.1.1.9, hangs them onto existing research, positions their unlocks and edits Vanilla research where needed, without touching the original `research.ini`. The extended file is generated at every game start in the TesmioLoader virtual file system (VFS).

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements
- Windows x64
- WRSR 1.1.1.9
- TesmioLoader API 4
- **Mandatory:** the Localization plugin (localization.dll), enabled. Without its service the extension is not applied.
- For new research: a Localization text pack with the names and descriptions (namespace `research_expansion`); it ships with the Localization package.

### In three steps
1. **Choose one installation method** (see below) and enable the plugin; Localization must be running.
2. **Enter research:** write new research blocks in `research_expansion.ini` (examples are inside, commented out), put icons as 128 x 128 PNG named `<research_id>.png` into the folder `tesmioloader\vfs\media_soviet\research` (Republic Mod Manager shows and opens it on the Research icons card). Edits of Vanilla research are most convenient in Republic Mod Manager.
3. **Restart the game completely.** The generated `research.ini` then sits under `tesmioloader\vfs\media_soviet\research`.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core function
- ✅ New research blocks with type, cost, unlocks, name and description in one INI
- ✅ Dependencies on Vanilla or new research through `+` lines; the reverse `$UNLOCK_RESEARCH` lines are created automatically and can be positioned with `@before_` and `@after_`
- ✅ Scoped edits of existing research: replace, remove, add, insert or move lines
- ✅ Own icons per research with a fallback icon
- ✅ Every error rejects the whole extension and leaves Vanilla research active; the log names file, rule and line
- ✅ Original files stay untouched; the generated file lives in the loader's VFS

### 🆕 New in 1.7
- ✅ **New research as an INI section:** `[research:<id>]` with the keys `type`, `cost`, `name`, `desc`, `requires`, `unlock` and `line` is the same research as a `$RESEARCH` block, only as a section so Republic Mod Manager can edit it. Both forms may be mixed and pass the same checks; sections are placed after the free blocks.

### 🆕 New in 1.6
- ✅ **One icon folder instead of two:** icons live only in `tesmioloader\vfs\media_soviet\research`, the folder the game reads them from. An icon that is there stays untouched; a missing one is created at start from `noimage.png` (from `research_expansion\icons` beside the DLL, else from `plugins\research_expansion\noimage.png`). The keys `icon_folder` and `noimage_name` are gone; old INIs with those keys keep working, a value other than the default is reported once in the log.

### 🆕 New in 1.5
- ✅ **INI and icons beside the DLL:** when `plugins\research_expansion.ini` does not exist, the DLL reads the INI from its own folder, i.e. from the Workshop package under Soviet Mod Loader or the Workshop Bridge. The icon folder is looked up the same way: first `plugins\research_expansion\icons`, otherwise beside the DLL. Both paths are logged.
- ✅ Editor schema for Republic Mod Manager in the package: edits of Vanilla research as a list, German and English.

## 💾 Installation

Choose **one** of the four methods. The same DLL must never be loaded twice. Localization must be installed and enabled in every case.

---

### Method 1️⃣: Classic TesmioLoader

```
1. Copy research_expansion.dll and research_expansion.ini from hooks\
   → tesmioloader\build\plugins\

2. Copy the folder hooks\research_expansion (the icons)
   → tesmioloader\build\plugins\research_expansion\

3. Enable research_expansion and localization in TesmioLauncher
4. Restart the game completely
```

---

### Method 2️⃣: Soviet Mod Loader (SML)

```
1. Subscribe to the Workshop item – SML reads subscribed packages by itself
2. SML loads the DLL through soviet.mod.ini from the package, INI and icons sit beside it
3. Remove or disable a local research_expansion.dll in plugins\ first
```

---

### Method 3️⃣: Workshop Bridge (without SML)

```
1. Select the package in Republic Mod Manager
2. Switch "Plugin active" on
3. workshop_bridge loads the DLL straight from the package; it finds INI and icons beside itself
4. Steam updates apply immediately
```

---

### Method 4️⃣: Republic Mod Manager with "Files local only"

```
1. Select the package in Republic Mod Manager, adjust the settings, Save
2. "General" tab, "Notes" card: switch "Files local only" on
3. Confirmation with file list → DLL, INI and the icon folder are copied to
   tesmioloader\build\plugins\ on save
4. The Workshop Bridge skips the package from then on
```

**"Files local only" in detail**
- For everyone who wants to keep using the plugin without the Steam subscription
- With local files, Steam updates apply only after saving again (yellow "Update" badge)
- Switching it off removes only the files Republic Mod Manager copied

---

## 🧰 Republic Mod Manager

The package ships an editor schema in the `config` folder. Republic Mod Manager (0.33.0 and later) shows Research Expansion in two tabs, German and English:

- **General:** notes, "Files local only", the button for this guide and the plugin settings (apply extension, research icons, diagnostic log)
- **Vanilla edits:** the edited research on the left, the selected one on the right with its switch and one multi-line field each for replace, remove, add, insert and move; the plus button adds an edit for a Vanilla research id

New research blocks (`$RESEARCH … $RESEARCH_ADD`) are free text blocks and are still written in the INI; Republic Mod Manager leaves them untouched. Personal changes live in `user_config\research_expansion.editor.ini`, the effective file is `plugins\research_expansion.ini`; the INI in the package stays untouched.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Main file: `research_expansion.ini`

The DLL reads in this order:
- **First:** `tesmioloader\build\plugins\research_expansion.ini` if it exists (classic installation, "Files local only", or the effective INI written by Republic Mod Manager)
- **Otherwise:** the INI beside the DLL, in the package `hooks\research_expansion.ini` (Soviet Mod Loader, Workshop Bridge)

⚠️ **Comments only on their own lines with `;`.** UTF-8 without BOM, at most 8 MiB. Directive names are case-sensitive. `[general]` allows only `enabled` and `debug` (`icon_folder` and `noimage_name` from 1.5 are ignored). Changes take effect after a complete restart.

### Section `[general]`

```ini
[general]
; 1 generates the extension, 0 removes the generated research.ini from the VFS on the next start
enabled = 1
; 1 logs staged operations, placements and local paths
debug = 0
```

⚠️ **Before disabling the DLL** set `enabled = 0` and start the game once: only then does the plugin remove the generated `research.ini` from the VFS. If the DLL is disabled straight in the launcher, the file stays and the game keeps reading the extended research.

---

## 🧪 New research

A block starts with `$RESEARCH <id>` and ends with `$RESEARCH_ADD`; it stands freely in the INI, not inside a `[section]`:

```ini
$RESEARCH quartz_smasher
+faculty_geology
@before_uranium_study
---------------------------------------
$TYPE_TECHNICAL
$COST 1800
$UNLOCK_BUILDING_PRODUCTION raw_quartz
$NAME research_expansion.quartz_smasher.name
$DESC research_expansion.quartz_smasher.desc
$RESEARCH_ADD
```

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$RESEARCH <id>` | Unique id of letters, digits and `_`; also names the icon `<id>.png` |
| `+<research>` | Prerequisite; several `+` lines form an AND condition. The parent automatically gets `$UNLOCK_RESEARCH <id>` |
| `@before_<x>` / `@after_<x>` | Position of that unlock in the parent, relative to its line `$UNLOCK_RESEARCH <x>`; applies to the last `+` line, never copied into the game |
| `$TYPE_TECHNICAL`, `$TYPE_SOVIET`, `$TYPE_MEDICAL` | exactly one |
| `$COST <number>` | 1 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `$NAME`, `$DESC` | language keys `namespace.key` from the Localization text pack; the resolved ids must lie between 2,000,000 and 2,999,999 |
| `$UNLOCK_…`, `$YEAR`, `$LOCK_AFTER_DAYS`, `$AVAILABLE`, `$IGNORE_…` | optional game directives as in the original research.ini |

Rules: unknown directives, missing required fields, duplicate directives, missing parents, self-references and cycles are rejected. `$AVAILABLE` cannot be combined with `+` lines. A line of dashes only is an allowed separator.

### As an INI section (since 1.7)

The same research as a section, the way Republic Mod Manager writes it:

```ini
[research:quartz_smasher]
requires = faculty_geology | before | uranium_study
type = technical
cost = 1800
unlock = $UNLOCK_BUILDING_PRODUCTION raw_quartz
name = research_expansion.quartz_smasher.name
desc = research_expansion.quartz_smasher.desc
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | `0` keeps the section but applies nothing; a missing key means `1` |
| `type` | `technical`, `soviet` or `medical` |
| `cost` | positive whole number |
| `name`, `desc` | language keys as with `$NAME` and `$DESC` |
| `requires` | one line per parent: `<research>`, optionally `\| before` or `\| after` and `\| <anchor>`; equals a `+` line plus `@before_`/`@after_` |
| `unlock` | one `$UNLOCK_…` line per entry |
| `line` | any other directive line, copied as it is |

Free blocks and sections may be mixed; an id may occur once. Sections are placed after the free blocks.

---

## ✏️ Editing Vanilla research

One section `[modify:<id>]` per existing research, in Republic Mod Manager one entry on the Vanilla edits tab:

```ini
[modify:faculty_geology]
enabled = 1
replace = $COST 1500 | $COST 1800
move_before = $UNLOCK_RESEARCH uranium_study | $UNLOCK_RESEARCH bauxite_study
```

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `remove = LINE` | remove exactly one matching complete line |
| `replace = OLD \| NEW` | replace exactly one line |
| `add = LINE` | insert immediately before `$RESEARCH_ADD` |
| `insert_before = ANCHOR \| LINE` / `insert_after = …` | insert before or after a unique anchor line |
| `move_before = LINE \| ANCHOR` / `move_after = …` | move an existing line unchanged |

The commands run in file order, after the automatic unlocks of new blocks; later ones see the changes of earlier ones. `$RESEARCH` and `$RESEARCH_ADD` themselves must not be touched. A `+` line added by a command is literal, without an automatic reverse unlock. `enabled = 0` skips the section, its syntax must still be valid. Matching needs the complete line including case; `|` is reserved as the separator.

---

## 🖼️ Icons and texts

**Icons:** PNG, exactly 128 x 128 pixels, at most 4 MiB, file name `<research_id>.png` in the folder `tesmioloader\vfs\media_soviet\research`. The plugin creates the folder on its first start. An icon that is there stays; a missing one is created from `noimage.png` and a warning is logged (source: `research_expansion\icons` beside the DLL, else `plugins\research_expansion\noimage.png`). An unusable icon in the folder or a missing `noimage.png` rejects the extension.

**Texts:** `$NAME` and `$DESC` refer to a Localization text pack, for example `plugins\localization\research_expansion\sovietEnglish.ini`:

```ini
[strings]
quartz_smasher.name = Quartz Crusher
quartz_smasher.desc = Crushes quartz for glass production.\nRequires additional workers.
```

The text pack belongs to the Localization plugin and ships with its package. Pure Vanilla edits with existing numeric text ids below 2,000,000 need neither a text pack nor icons; the Localization service stays mandatory.

---

## 📏 Value ranges

| Quantity | Limit |
|---|---|
| `enabled`, `debug` | exactly 0 or 1 |
| `$COST` | 1 to 2,147,483,647 |
| resolved text ids | 2,000,000 to 2,999,999 |
| INI | at most 8 MiB |
| active research blocks | at most 256 |
| edit sections / commands | at most 256 / 4096 |
| line inside a command | at most 4096 bytes |
| `+` and `$UNLOCK_RESEARCH` lines of new blocks | at most 4096 together |
| icon | PNG, 128 x 128, at most 4 MiB |

---

## 💾 Compatibility

### Savegames
Research is part of the savegame: a new research a savegame already knows should keep its id. The Vanilla file stays unchanged; without the plugin the game reads its own `research.ini` again once the VFS copy is removed (see `enabled = 0`).

### Other plugins
Localization is mandatory. Other plugins that replace `research.ini` are not merged.

### Version compatibility
- **1.7:** `[research:<id>]` sections as the INI form of new research; otherwise unchanged
- **1.6:** icons only in the VFS folder `media_soviet\research`, existing ones stay, missing ones come from `noimage.png`; `icon_folder`/`noimage_name` removed
- **1.5:** INI and icon fallback beside the DLL, editor schema in the package; validation and generation unchanged from 1.4
- **1.4:** positioned unlocks, edit sections `[modify:]`
- **Going back to an older version:** restore the old DLL and its INI

---

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### Common problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Extension is not applied | Localization missing or off | install and enable localization.dll |
| `Localization key ... could not be resolved` | key missing in the text pack | check the text pack, write the key exactly |
| `No icon for ... and no usable noimage.png` | icon and fallback icon missing | put a 128 x 128 PNG named `<id>.png` into `vfs\media_soviet\research` or provide `noimage.png` |
| `Icon for ... is unusable` | PNG in the VFS folder broken or wrong size | replace or delete the file, it is then recreated from `noimage.png` |
| `Unknown directive` | typo or unsupported directive | compare the line with the original research.ini |
| `Research ... already exists` | duplicate id | choose a unique id |
| `Dependency cycle detected` | cycle in the `+` lines | untangle the dependencies |
| Research still visible after disabling | DLL disabled without `enabled = 0` first | enable the plugin, set `enabled = 0`, start the game once |

### Logging

All messages go to `tesmioloader.log` and the detail log `tesmioloader.research_expansion.log`, with rule names such as `placement-target`, `modify-match`, `research-cycle`.
- In **Republic Mod Manager** the document icon at the bottom of the plugin bar opens the log view with filter and sender.

Look for:
- `Configuration file`, `Icon store` and `Fallback icon` → which INI, icon folder and fallback icon were chosen
- `research_expansion` → every message of the plugin, rejections with rule and line

## 📜 Licence & credits

**GNU GPL v3**, see `LICENSE` in the package. The plugin contains no third-party code; the loader SDK header comes from the TesmioLoader by MaxLegend (GPL v3). The complete source lives at https://github.com/Kespri/workers-and-resources-mods/tree/main/plugins/research_expansion.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is my research.ini modified?**
A: No. The extended file is generated in the loader's VFS; the original stays untouched.

**Q: Why don't I see my new research?**
A: Usually Localization or a language key is missing, or an error rejected the whole extension. The detail log names the cause.

**Q: Can I edit Vanilla research only, without adding new ones?**
A: Yes. Edit sections work without new blocks; only the Localization service must be running.

**Q: How do I get rid of the extension again?**
A: Switch the plugin off, start the game once, then disable the DLL. That way the plugin cleans up the VFS.

**Q: Do I have to edit the INI by hand?**
A: For new research blocks, yes. Edits of Vanilla research and the plugin settings are offered by Republic Mod Manager as a list with descriptions.
