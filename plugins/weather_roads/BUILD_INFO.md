# Weather Roads – build notes

TesmioLoader plugin (API 4) for WRSR 1.1.1.9, GPL v3. Build: the standard line of the root
`build.bat` (`cl /O2 /MT /W3 /EHsc /std:c++17 /LD`, kernel32.lib) compiles `weather_roads.cpp`;
it includes `src/tesmio_plugin.h`, `my_plugins/grit_spreader_api.h` (consumer side of the
`tss.grit_spreader` service of Technical Service Storage) and the two persistence headers
`weather_roads_persistence.h` / `weather_roads_persistence_format.h` (sidecar
`tesmioloader.weather_roads.protection.bin` beside the savegame). Hooks are installed only on the
verified SOVIET64.exe / C3DDLL64.dll build. User documentation: README_DE.md / README_EN.md.
History newest first.

## 0.3.3 (2026-09-09)

- Defaults `[snow] accumulation_multiplier` 0.30 -> 0.35 and `maximum_accumulation_per_burst`
  50 -> 95 (user decision after in-game tuning: too little snow stayed after short snowfalls).
  Changed in the compiled-in `g_cfg` initialiser, both INIs, the schema/DE/EN descriptions and
  the README tables. No code path changed. Users with their own values in `user_config` are not
  affected; the package defaults_hash changes, so RMM shows the update marker once.
- Fix: 0.3.1 inserted `releaseFollowsWeather` into `WeatherRoadsConfig` without adding an entry to
  the aggregate initialiser of `g_cfg`, so every compiled-in default after it was shifted by one
  (that was the source of the C4244/C4838 warnings at the initialiser, wrongly taken for
  pre-existing). No runtime effect as long as the INI carries every key, because the readers
  fall back to those values only for missing keys. Entry added, the build is warning-free again.

## 0.3.2 (2026-09-09)

- `+0xE28` of the world object is the winter weather roll, not a 0/1/2 precipitation state.
  Disassembly of the winter routine (exe+0x5D06B8..0x5D08FA): when the period timer at `+0xE2C`
  expires the game rolls `rand % 3` on climate 3 and `rand % 8` on every other climate, so the
  field holds 0..7. Only 1 is snowfall: the +30 road-snow ticks (`0x42AF60`, return RVA
  `0x5D08F5` in the limiter log) and the flags at `+0x5E4` run only for 1; 0 and 2..7 are all
  "no snow". Confirmed in the user's log (accumulation calls only during state 1, none during 2)
  and by a read-only memory probe of the paused game (roll 6 while the plugin reported
  "unavailable").
- `ReadWeatherSnapshot` accepts 0..7 (was 0..2). With the old range the snapshot was refused on
  5 of 8 rolls: 23 "weather tick unavailable" events in a 12-minute session, overlay "no world
  data", and `release_follows_weather` could not act.
- `release_follows_weather` drops the queue on any roll other than 1 (was: only 0). Event line
  carries `precipitation_state=<n> (<name>)`.
- `WeatherRollName`: dry / snow / no snow / unknown for the weather EVENT lines and the overlay;
  the overlay's old "rain" label for 2 was wrong.
- Package: INI comment, schema and DE/EN descriptions say "snowfall" instead of "precipitation"
  and "a few seconds" instead of "half a minute" (the burst maximum caps the queue at 80 units,
  4.4 s at step 2 / 110 ms).
- In-game test 2026-09-09 21:45 (user): 23 weather lines with named rolls 0..7 in two minutes, no
  "weather tick unavailable" line, one snowfall (roll 1, 11 ticks, 100 units queued) ended by
  "gradual snow release stopped with the weather: precipitation_state=4 (no snow), dropped_units=4"
  19 ms before the roll change was logged.

## 0.3.1 (2026-09-09)

- `[snow] release_follows_weather` (default 1, 0..1): `ServiceGradualRoadSnow` reads the weather
  snapshot before every release step; with `precipitation_state == 0` the remaining queued units
  are dropped (counted in `g_gradualSnowCancelledUnits`, one EVENT line), the next-step tick is
  cleared and the visual batch flushed. `ReadWeatherSnapshot` failing (no capture, stale > 30 s,
  implausible values) leaves the release untouched - fail open. Values seen in the user's log:
  precipitation_state 1 while it snows, 0 afterwards (plausible range 0..2).
- Reason: the queue (up to 255 units at 1 unit / 125 ms) kept whitening roads for up to ~30 s
  after the snowfall had visibly ended. The alternative of holding the weather object in the
  snowing state was rejected (feedback into the same queue, fighting the game's weather machine).
- Startup INFO line now ends with `release follows weather=on|off`.
- Package: schema field on the Snow tab (order 45), DE/EN texts, INI comment, READMEs.
- In-game test: pending (user).

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-08)

- Final number of the September rework (user's call); follows 0.2.11-beta, the DLL logic is
  unchanged. Scheme from here on: 0.M.P, patch increments per change, the next minor when a change
  is large.
- Workshop package texts (RMM schema, de/en) rewritten in the user's gamer style: 47/46 keys,
  every boolean described with ON/OFF, line breaks (`\n`) in longer descriptions, the group
  description of the General card dropped, the restart/Technical Service Storage note moved to
  `[launcher] notice` (needs Republic Mod Manager 0.4.3), the plow formula removed from the UI,
  "strong phase" renamed "protection phase after plowing".
- READMEs: same naming, plain wording for melting, visual mapping and the sidecar check.

## 0.2.11-beta (2026-09-07)

- INI fallback beside the DLL: `plugins\weather_roads.ini` when present, otherwise the INI next to
  the DLL (Workshop package under Soviet Mod Loader or the Workshop Bridge); own `ConfigString`
  reader identical to the loader's (GetPrivateProfileStringA plus trim). Chosen path logged as
  `configuration file:`.
- Workshop package `My Plugins\weather_roads` with a five-tab RMM schema (33 fields).

## 0.2.10 and earlier

- 0.2.10: defensive loader checks, cleanup on exceptions, clearer start messages.
- 0.2.8: corrected save timing of the sidecar (written after the final native file close).
- 0.2.x: scaled and optionally gradual road-snow build-up with a per-burst cap, independent natural
  melting scale, protection phase (game minutes) followed by a weaker salt phase (game hours) with a
  configurable factor, material strength and dry-plowing detection through the grit spreader
  service, visual snow correction on tracked plowed areas, F10 diagnostic overlay with built-in
  German/English texts, protection persistence beside the savegame.
